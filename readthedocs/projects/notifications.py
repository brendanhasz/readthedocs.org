    Notification for the usage of deprecated webhook endpoints.

    Each time that a view decorated with ``notify_deprecated_endpoint`` is hit,
    a new instance of this class is created. Then, ``.send`` is called and the
    ``SiteBackend`` will create (avoiding duplication) a site notification and
    the ``EmailBackend`` will do nothing (because of ``send_email=False``).

    Besides, a ``message_extends.models.Message`` object is created to track
    sending an email if this endpoint is hit again after ``email_period``. When,
    ``.send`` is call and the ``email_period`` was reach from the
    ``Message.created`` time we mark ``send_email=True`` in this instance and
    call the super ``.send`` method that will effectively send the email and
    mark the message as ``extra_tags='email_sent'``.
